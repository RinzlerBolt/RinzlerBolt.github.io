            <h2>Project Details</h2>
            <p>This project was a task set by Staffordshire University, where we were challenged to develop three games featuring Spline Generation,
                 a Tank Controller, and a Wave Spawner. The complexity lay in integrating everything we had learned while writing efficient, modular scripts.
                  I made it a personal goal as a developer to avoid relying on the Update methods unless absolutely necessary. Each system was designed to be highly modular,
                   allowing for easy modification by designers. The Wave Spawner, in particular, was designed to be extremely flexible,
                    with its behavior easily adjustable through simple variable changes.

            <p>
                Despite facing several background challenges, I successfully delivered every system and mechanic within the set timeframe. The circumstances were far from easy,
                 but the level of detail in each aspect of my work speaks for itself. One of the highlights was developing the Tank Controllerâ€”I aimed to make the suspension system as
                  realistic as possible. After struggling with it, I took a drive, hit a few bumps, and formed a theory, which ultimately worked out.
                   The Wave Spawner was another rewarding experience, especially as I explored ECS (Entity Component System), which greatly optimized performance.
                    Lastly, the Spline Mesh Generator, originally intended for a rollercoaster, was reimagined as a car on a road with streetlights.
                     There is still room for improvement, and I plan to revisit and refine my processes in the future.
