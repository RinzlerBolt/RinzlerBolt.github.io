            <ul>
                <li>Implemented Basic AI Movement Systems.</li>
                <li>Developed Pathfinding, Jump Point Search, A*, Djikstra's Algorithms</li>
                <li>Made a User Interface on the Interactions the AI had to the Game</li>
                <li>Created an AI Behaviour Tree System, with Nodes and Queries. Like UE5's Behaviour Tree</li>

            <h2>Project Details</h2>
            <p>We were given 12 AI tasks to work with, and create AI behaviors for each of them, they ramped up in difficulty over time. From simply following the player character, to attacking,
                to creating AI pathfinding algorithms like Jump Point Search, A*, and Djikstra's. It was a challenge for sure, and allowed me to express my creativity in creating a very smooth flowing AI.
                My favourite AI development was A*.

            <p>
                This was one of the toughest projects I've faced, especially given my personal circumstances at the time. It was a testament to my ability to work under extreme pressure,
                 and Iâ€™m proud that I completed all the tasks despite the challenges in the background. Out of all the mechanics,
                  I found the Pathfinding Algorithms to be my favorite, as they pushed my problem-solving skills and were incredibly rewarding to implement.
