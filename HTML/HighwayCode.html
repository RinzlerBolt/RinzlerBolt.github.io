            <p>Compete head-to-head in this split-screen racing experience as rival delivery drivers for opposing mafia organizations.
                 Your objective: deliver more packages than your opponent before time runs out. Use power-ups to sabotage and distract your rival,
                  but stay alertâ€”city-wide events like falling bombs, police chases, and low gravity will constantly mix up the gameplay, keeping you on your toes.</p>

            <p>
                This game is one that I take great pride in, as it truly tested my collaboration, teamwork, and leadership skills. Despite numerous changes during development,
                 we remained focused on our end goal: delivering a fun yet challenging experience. Initially, the concept revolved around players adhering to the highway code,
                  with penalties for breaking laws that triggered a variety of world states to disrupt progress. However, we shifted to a system of dynamic,
                   ever-changing world states, with only one active at a time to avoid overwhelming the player. This project holds a special place for me,
                    as it fueled my passion for the game industry and reinforced my dedication to crafting engaging experiences.
