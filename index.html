                <h3>BeTamworth Award</h3>
                <p>
                    On behalf of Coliseum Cards, In 2018 I was proudly awarded the BeTamworth Award along with the team at Coliseum Cards.
                    The award was presented by the then Mayor Richard Kingston, 
                    the award given was for our work in the local commmunity for adults and children with additional needs, 
                    also for creating a positive impact on the town of Tamworth when we host major tournamnets, 
                    bringing players for all over the country to use the local shops and cafes.
                    My role was to teach children and adults how to play the trading card games.
                    With the work of Sharon and Mark Lawson who are the owners, we made a safe environment
                    for our players and  visitors.

                    <p>
                        Hi, I'm Jake Lawson, a passionate and self-motivated Game Developer. I dedicate my time to mastering both new and existing programming languages, with a particular focus on C++ and C#.
                        However, I'm always eager to explore a wide range of languages, whether they're older or cutting-edge. I enjoy diving into software, breaking down code to understand its intricacies,
                        and applying that knowledge to create engaging software and games. My research interests lie in the video game market and virtual reality,
                        where I aim to push boundaries and craft fun, immersive experiences.

                         I enjoy visiting historic sites from this period and studying both military and civilian vehicles to understand their historical significance.
                          For example, I often compare aircraft like the British Spitfire and the German Messerschmitt Bf 109, analyzing their design, performance,
                           and impact during World War II. I am eager to expand my knowledge further by traveling the world and uncovering more about our world.

                    <p>I enjoy playing a wide range of card and board games, with a particular focus on Yu-Gi-Oh!, Magic: The Gathering, and Lorcana.
                         I also like cooperative board games such as Pandemic, Castle Panic, Not Alone, and Hanabi.
                          In addition, I have experience playing Dungeons & Dragons. As mentioned earlier, I am a certified Konami Yu-Gi-Oh! Judge.</p>

                    <p>I mix a variety of genres, including Drum and Bass, House, and Hardstyle, blending them into unique tracks. In my spare time,
                        I dedicate my time into experimenting with new songs and exploring other genres to expand my musical range.
                         My goal is to take my skills public, performing at parties, events, and other venues.
